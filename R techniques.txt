To extract specific rows of data based on specified condition(s):
x <- "data.csv"
y <- subset(x, condition(s))


To extract a set of columns from data frame:
z <- x[1:3]   ##this would extract columns 1-3 of the data and store it in the variable "z"


To print the mean of each column (where x is the data):
colMeans(x, TRUE)  ## TRUE tells the function to ignore NA's


To create a simple vector (concatenate):
c(value1, value2, ... etc)


To access help docs on a function, type '?' and then the function:
ie. '?c' will provide the help docs on c()


A lot of file commands (like create and rename) can be found with the command prefix 'file.'


To delete a directory:
unlink("directory", recursive = TRUE)


for loop structure:

for(i in 1:10) {
	## do something
}

## can also use 'seq_along(variable)' which produces the length of the vector variable

ie:
for(i in seq_along(x) {
	## do something
}
